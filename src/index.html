            I am from the small town of Dresden, Tennessee. My interests are in
            gaming and web development, so I would like my career to be in those
            fields. My current objective is to gain experience in the field of
            web developmnent and learn many new skills along the way.

            In 2019, I graduated from Dresden High School with honors in the top
            15 of my class. I am currently studying Computer Science at the
            University of Tennessee at Martin, and I expect to graduate in May
            2022.

            co-author of a published abstract of the "Learning Algorithms on the
            Web" project below. I was elected as the Treasurer for the student
            chapter of the University of Tennessee at Martin ACM Club. I was a
            member of the National Beta Club from middle school to high school.

              This was my senior design (or capstone) project. My partner and I
              presented this project at the ACM Midsoutheast Conference in
              Gatlinbutg, Tennessee on November 11-12, 2021. I created and
              managed the back end of this web app. This mostly involved sending
              http requests to an Express.js server that connected to a MongoDB
              database. I also implemented a user code feature that allows users
              to write their own implementations of algorithms and upload their
              files to our cloud database. The user would then be able to
              download their files whenever and wherever they wanted. This app
              was structured with the MERN stack, so I learned a lot about full
              stack web development from this project. Click here to visit the

            <p class="paragraph">
              This was my term project for my Computer Graphics class. As the
              project's name implies, this simulator demonstrates gravity on the
              cosmological scale. The project uses actual values for the masses
              of planets and distances between them, but on a smaller scale. The
              project also uses actual physics equations like the gravitation
              equation to make the simulator as accurate as possible. I wrote
              this program using Three.js, which I really enjoyed using. In the
              screenshot to the right, you can see the Sun and Earth in
              Three.js.

              This was my term project for my Software Engineering class. This
              app currently allows you to play blackjack with the app's own
              currency (real currency is not needed). This project is not yet
              complete, which is why the UI looks the way it does. Originally,
              the app was supposed to implement three different casino games,
              but my partner and I only had time to make one. We wrote this
              program in C# using the Visual Studio IDE. The app uses a
              Microsoft Access database to store user credentials and balances.
              User credentials are hashed and salted to keep them as secure as
              possible. One of the main purposes for this project was to get
              practice with implementing design patterns into a project. In this
              project, I implemented the Factory Method and Facade design
              patterns. I used the Factory Method to create cards to use in the
              game, and Facade to make playing the game easier for the user.
